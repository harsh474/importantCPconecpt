Thanks to Chinese remainder theorem, a number is divisible by 60 if and only if it is divisible by 3  and 20 .

A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Note that as the sum doesn't change if we reorder digits, it applies also to the sum of digits of s .

A number is divisible by 20  if it ends in 40,80 , 60, 80 or00 . Hence, it is necessary and sufficient if  contains a 0 and then at least one additional even digit.

Overall, there are three conditions to check:

The digit sum is divisible by 3 .
There is at least a single 0 .
There are at least two even digits (including 0).
